# **Policy Impact Graph**

### **📌 Overview**
This project is a **React-based web application** that visualizes policy decisions and their cascading economic and social impacts using an **interactive force-directed graph**. 

It uses **react-force-graph** to dynamically render the relationships between policies, economic factors, and their consequences in a **hierarchical, top-down structure**.

---

## **🚀 Features**
✅ **Interactive Graph** – Zoom, pan, and explore nodes dynamically  
✅ **Hierarchical Layout** – Policies at the top, impacts cascading downward  
✅ **Custom Styling** – Larger nodes, readable labels, directional arrows  
✅ **Deployed on Vercel** – Easily accessible via a shareable link

## **🛠 Technologies Used**
- **React.js** – Frontend framework
- **react-force-graph** – D3-based graph visualization
- **Vercel** – Deployment platform
